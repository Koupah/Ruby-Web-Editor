# Ruby-Web-Editor
Ruby terminal application made to allow for simple personal customization of websites

## Why does this exist?

Made this for a piece of assessment and it is now my first ruby application

## Trello

Whilst developing this application I (barely) kept track of my status on [trello](https://trello.com/b/CsE5FMiv/ruby-web-editor)

## Notes:

I used camelCase instead of snake_case because I thought I'd be edgy and different... next time I'll use snake_case :)  
This is, once again, my first ruby application so be nice.  
If you look through the commits you can see I rushed this out in ~ 3 days.
